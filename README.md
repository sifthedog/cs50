Pset1 - Some C introduction

Pset2 - Some extra C with strings

Pset3 - More C with image processing

Pset5 - Instead... How about you check my dog's webpage? www.sifthedog.com (It's my first webpage using only HTML and CSS. Don't be too harsh)

Pset6 - Python files. Remake of some of those C files plus the bleep.py (it censors a word in a phrase)

Pset8 - This one was really fun! This is by far the best pset (sorry crack.c and others I've loved making)! It's an stock broker. You may add funds, buy and sell shares, check your history. 

I know it isn't state of the art, but I am a mechanical engineering student and I am doing this all by myself.
