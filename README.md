Pset1 - Some C introduction
Pset2 - Some extra C with strings
Pset3 - More C with image processing (couldn't recover my resize.c and recover.c unfortunately)
Pset4 - How about some extra C with tries and hash table? (couldn't recover, I am remaking it. If you are a recruiter, could you please check again 22/9/2019 first thing in the morning?)
Pset5 - Instead... How about you check my dog's webpage? www.sifthedog.com (I am building it yet
Pset6 - Python files. Remake of some of those C files plus the bleep.py (it censors a word in a phrase)
Pset7 - I've found Survey way too easy so I jumped to the next Pset (if you are a recruiter, you may e-mail me requiring this pset and I shall deliver it in 48 hours or a bit longer - I work!)
Pset8 - This one was really fun! This is by far the best pset (sorry crack.c and others I've loved making)! It's an stock broker. You may add funds, buy and sell shares, check your history. But... There are already some problems I mapped and that I need to fix, like: remove funds button, limit number input.

I know it isn't state of the art, but I am a mechanical engineering student and I am doing this all by myself.
